# Mixing color
# Ask the user to input one of the three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. 
# Ask for a second primary color. 
# If the user answer incorrectly, prompt the user to try again. 
# Combine these two colors and give the user an output. 
# (red + yellow = orange; red + blue = purple; yellow + blue = green)

# Sample output:
# Hello, welcome to our color mixing program!
# Give me one primary color
# Green
# Sorry, green is not a primary color, try again!
# Yellow
# Great! Could you give me a second primary color? 
# Blue 
# Awesome! 
# yellow plus blue is green
